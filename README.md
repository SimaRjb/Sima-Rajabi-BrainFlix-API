## **Server Side**
## **About**
- Completed within three weeks, this mock SPA (single-page application) for streaming videos showcases proficiency in React, React-Router, Node.js, Express.js, APIs, and other front-end essentials

## **Goals and Achievements**
My goal was to develop a full-stack single-page application from scratch using React, Express, and Node.js. I integrated an API to fetch video data, stream URLs, and default comments. For styling, I followed a provided mock-up, ensuring a responsive app aligned with the specifications.

## **Key Learnings**
- Mastered React fundamentals, including component lifecycle methods, utilizing props and state, and JSX.
- Implemented React-Router for efficient routing.
- Developed foundational skills in Node.js and Express, creating API endpoints for data interaction.
- Applied Semantic HTML and BEM methodology for structured and maintainable code.
- Utilized Flexbox, SAAS, and adopted a mobile-first design approach for responsive layouts.
- Leveraged Axios for streamlined API calls and data management.
